## ü©∫ Liver Disease Diagnosis and Predictor Development

### üìä Dataset

This project leverages the **Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD)** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/225/ilpd+indian+liver+patient+dataset). It contains medical records spanning from 2011 to 2022, including liver function test results and demographic details such as:

* **Age**, **Gender**
* **Total Bilirubin**, **Direct Bilirubin**
* **Alkaline Phosphatase**, **Alanine Aminotransferase**, **Aspartate Aminotransferase**
* **Total Proteins**, **Albumin**, **Albumin and Globulin Ratio**
* **Target Variable**: Presence or absence of liver disease (binary)

---

### üéØ Objective

The goal of this project is to:

* Identify **key clinical indicators** of liver disease
* Develop a robust **machine learning pipeline** to predict the likelihood of liver disease
* Deploy an **interactive R Shiny dashboard** to visualize findings and enable dynamic predictions

### üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

#### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

* Handling missing values
* Encoding categorical variables
* Scaling and normalizing skewed features

#### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Univariate and bivariate analysis
* Correlation matrices and statistical tests
* Visualization of distribution patterns and relationships

#### 3. **Feature Engineering**

* Deriving new features based on domain insights
* Eliminating redundant or low-importance variables

#### 4. **Model Development**

* Implementing and comparing:

  * **Logistic Regression**
  * **Random Forest**
  * **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
* Model evaluation with **cross-validation** and performance metrics (accuracy, ROC-AUC, precision, recall)

#### 5. **Deployment**

* Developed an **R Shiny App** to:

  * Visualize EDA insights
  * Display real-time model predictions
  * Enable comparison of model performance

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Addressed

* **Class imbalance** mitigated using techniques such as oversampling (e.g., SMOTE)
* **Model selection and tuning** for performance and generalization
* Building a **user-friendly dashboard** suitable for both technical and clinical stakeholders
